# A Century and Two Decades of Olympic Transformation
## Project Overview

This project explores the evolution of the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. Through data analysis and visualization, we delve into various aspects such as athlete demographics, performance enhancements, and changes in medal distributions. The aim is to uncover how the Olympics have transformed over time, reflecting broader shifts in global participation, gender dynamics, and athletic performance.
